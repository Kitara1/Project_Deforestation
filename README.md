  "tidyverse", "lubridate","dplyr","DT",# for wrangling
  "reshape2","ggrepel", "gghighlight", "patchwork", "maps", "tmap", "scales", "leaflet", "sf", "sp", "spData", "highcharter",
  "cowplot", "googleway", "ggplot2","corrplot","standardize","plm","psych","VIF","olsrr","gplots","plotly","coefplot",
  "rnaturalearth", "rnaturalearthdata","kableExtra","jtools","vtable","Hmisc", "MASS",
  "knitr", "kableExtra", "bookdown", "rmarkdown"
